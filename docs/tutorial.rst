After installation, use `wc_env_manager` by creating a wc environment, and then executing commands in the environment. `wc` is the primary application for using the environment. It supports multiple commands, which in turn have sub-commands, options and arguments:

* Run `wc create` to create a new wc environment.
* Run `wc reuse <name>` to reuse an existing environment called `<name>`.
* Run `wc --help` to obtain help for `wc_env_manager`, including descriptions of the 
  arguments for each command.
